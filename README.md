# Difference-Objects-Classes
An object in Java is a real world entity described in the syntax of Java. It is a way to store multiple different variables and data types into one neat piece of code. In our homework we created a microwave class, using that class we created our microwave, while we did not describe the microwave with attributes we did add methods to the microwave object. We gave it the ability to turn on, off, add 30 seconds, and change between power levels.

A class is a template to create objects from. The class is also used to encapsulate the attributes and methods of the object, this keeps them together. The class is basically the blue print to build the object from. As an example the recipie for a cake is a class while the cake that is baked is a object.
